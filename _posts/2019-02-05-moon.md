M drinks a lot today ,i don't like that for his body (or maybe just some personal things) . But M enjoys this precious moment with those guys  who r in a good relationship with M. Actually,i have no idea about whether or not to let M know the real feelings inside of me, ya a little bit confused...

### <font color="red" size="4">Comment:
I drank a lot enheng and enheng today but not enheng, (mua) okay, You are the only guy with me but not them and It’s my happiness to know your real feelings, who let me be the soft ear...

 # 你扫再多的福，也没有跟奚奚在⼀起幸福

 Oh!!! There’s something important that i used to connect ‘XY’ with the unknown number,even believe that my life is unpredictable in my junior high school period（ahh！），that’s too funny,right? And when i saw these as follows, I reckoned that the world is full of charms.

 Sometimes I’m indeed afraid of the substantial divergences between u and me, with my firm faith that we are perfectly matched ideologically.
